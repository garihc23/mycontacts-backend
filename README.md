## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Contacts Manager Backend is responsible for handling HTTP requests, managing the database, and providing authentication services for the Contacts Manager application.

## 2. Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"></a>

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing contact information.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication.

## 3. Project Structure <a name="project-structure"></a>

- `index.js`: Entry point of the server.
- `routes/`: Contains route handlers for various endpoints.
- `controllers/`: Defines the logic for handling requests.
- `models/`: Contains Mongoose models for data structure.
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions (e.g., authentication).
- `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., environment variables).
- `utils/`: Utility functions.

## 4. API Endpoints <a name="api-endpoints"></a>

### GET /api/contacts
- **Description**: Retrieves a list of all contacts.
- **Request**: None.
- **Response**: List of contact objects.

### POST /api/contacts
- **Description**: Adds a new contact.
- **Request**: JSON body with contact information.
- **Response**: Newly created contact object.

### GET /api/contacts/:id
- **Description**: Retrieves a specific contact by ID.
- **Request**: Contact ID as a parameter.
- **Response**: Contact object.

### PUT /api/contacts/:id
- **Description**: Updates an existing contact by ID.
- **Request**: Contact ID as a parameter, JSON body with updated contact information.
- **Response**: Updated contact object.

### DELETE /api/contacts/:id
- **Description**: Deletes a contact by ID.
- **Request**: Contact ID as a parameter.
- **Response**: Success message.

### POST /api/users/register
- **Description**: Registers a new user.
- **Request**: JSON body with user credentials (username, password).
- **Response**: User object with JWT token.

### POST /api/users/login
- **Description**: Logs in an existing user.
- **Request**: JSON body with user credentials (username, password).
- **Response**: User object with JWT token.

## 5. Authentication <a name="authentication"></a>

- Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- A token is generated upon successful login and sent to the client.
- The token is included in the headers of protected routes for authorization.

## 6. Error Handling <a name="error-handling"></a>

- Errors are handled using Express error middleware.
- Custom error messages and status codes are returned in the response.

## 7. Database Schema <a name="database-schema"></a>

- **Contact Schema**:
  - name: String
  - email: String
  - phone: String

- **User Schema**:
  - username: String
  - password: String (hashed)


## 8. Known Issues <a name="known-issues"></a>

- In rare cases, the server may experience performance issues when handling a large number of simultaneous requests. This could be optimized further by implementing caching mechanisms or horizontal scaling.

- The current implementation does not include rate limiting for API endpoints. Implementing rate limiting can help protect against abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.

## 9. Future Improvements <a name="future-improvements"></a>

- Implement user roles and permissions to allow for different levels of access within the application. For example, an admin role could have additional privileges compared to a regular user.

- Introduce automated testing for both unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the backend.

- Incorporate logging and monitoring solutions to track the performance and health of the server. This could include tools like Winston or integrating with services like AWS CloudWatch.

- Consider implementing a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve the response time of frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database.

- Enhance security measures by implementing features like two-factor authentication and encryption of sensitive data.

- Implement a feature to allow users to reset their password in case they forget it. This could be done through email verification or security questions.

- Optimize database queries and indexes to improve the overall performance, especially as the dataset grows.
